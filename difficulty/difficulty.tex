            \vspace{0.5em}
            \textbf{Tires} \\
            50:50 tires should be considered a minimum for rides. All of our routes have extensive off-pavement sections and riding street-oriented tires just puts the rest of the group at risk of unfortunate delays. \textbf{Anything above level II should not be attempted without proper knobbies}.

            \vspace{1.5em}

            \textbf{Physical Fitness} \\
            \noindent Physical Fitness plays a significant role in adventure riding. Rides take up to 8 hours and can have sustained levels of difficulty. If you find yourself on a route that challenges your skills, we are never far from any exit route. Weather can also play a significant role in the difficulty of a route.

    \textbf{Difficulty Levels}

    Consider that the difficulty of a route is not just about the terrain, but also the weather, the group, and your own skill level. The difficulty level is a guide to help you choose an adventure that is appropriate for your skills and abilities. If you are unsure, ask a ride leader for advice.
    \vspace{0.2em}
    The routes are laid out with an \textit{choose your own adventure} style in mind. The guided groups will roughly follow one of the levels (you always have the option of skipping Hero sections, even in the guided groups).

            I              & Suitable for beginners and all bike types. Mostly paved roads with some well-maintained gravel sections. Expect hard-packed surfaces, minimal elevation changes, no technical obstacles, and occasional small water crossings (up to 4 inches deep). This can include rough paved roads with broken bits, potholes, and mud, alongside well-maintained gravel roads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\
            \hline
            II             & Suitable for novice off-road riders. Includes maintained dirt and gravel roads, rough resource roads, and smooth double track. Expect some loose surfaces, minor elevation changes, and small water crossings (less than 6 inches deep). You may encounter small and infrequent trail obstacles, patches of soft gravel, shallow sand, or small surface mud. All hills are gentle. \textbf{OFF-ROAD EXPERIENCE RECOMMENDED, some basic off-road skills required.}                                                                                                                                                                                     \\
            \hline
            III            & Requires some off-road experience. Includes rougher trails with some technical features, such as doubletrack with routine modest features like roots and rocks. Expect extended loose gravel and dirt sections, moderate elevation changes, and water crossings up to 12 inches. Some steep hills, but short in duration. \textbf{OFF-ROAD EXPERIENCE STRONGLY RECOMMENDED}                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\
            \hline
            IV             & Requires solid off-road skills. Features difficult terrain but generally rideable. Expect rough, uneven surfaces, significant elevation changes, and water crossings up to 18 inches. This includes doubletrack with routine features such as roots, ledges, rocks, and soft patches, as well as singletrack with infrequent obstacles. Multiple technical obstacles requiring good skill. Mud is common. \textbf{OFF-ROAD EXPERIENCE REQUIRED}                                                                                                                                                                           \\
            \hline
            V              & For experienced off-road riders only. Features very technical terrain with very rough, loose surfaces. Expect steep inclines and declines, and deep water crossings (up to 24 inches). This includes single and double track with frequent and potentially sizable features such as roots, ledges, rocks, and soft patches. Multiple challenging obstacles requiring advanced skill; some obstacles require commitment and don't have easy by-passes. Steep hills can be sustained and may have unforgiving transitions. Corners may be tight and unforgiving. Mud holes and water crossings are common. \textbf{ADVANCED OFF-ROAD EXPERIENCE REQUIRED} \\

            \rowcolor{lightgrey}
            VI             & For expert off-road riders only. Features extremely demanding terrain and obstacles with extremely rough, unstable surfaces. Expect very steep, technical climbs or descents, and deep water or mud crossings (over 24 inches). Major obstacles requiring expert skills. Challenging for dirt bikers, so yeah, it's really tough for anything bigger. Make sure you can ride a few Level V routes before trying a Level VI.   \textbf{YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND YOU'RE ASKING FOR IT}                                                                                                                                                              \\

            % VII              & Extremely challenging routes, even for the very best riders on smaller adventure bikes. Unavoidable large obstacles requiring significant commitment and potentially some nasty exposure. Train hard to possibly do one someday so you can tick that box, and never have to do another again! \\
