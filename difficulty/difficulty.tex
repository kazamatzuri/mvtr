            \vspace{0.5em}
            \textbf{Tires} \\
            50:50 tires should be considered a minimum for rides. All of our routes have extensive off-pavement sections and riding street-oriented tires just puts the rest of the group at risk of unfortunate delays. \textbf{Anything above level II should not be attempted without proper knobbies}.

            \vspace{1.5em}

            \textbf{Physical Fitness} \\
            \noindent Physical Fitness plays a significant role in adventure riding. Rides take up to 8 hours and can have sustained levels of difficulty. If you find yourself on a route that challenges your skills, we are never far from any exit route. Weather can also play a significant role in the difficulty of a route.

    \textbf{Difficulty Levels}

    Consider that the difficulty of a route is not just about the terrain, but also the weather, the group, and your own skill level. The difficulty level is a guide to help you choose an adventure that is appropriate for your skills and abilities. If you are unsure, ask a ride leader for advice.
    \vspace{0.2em}
    The routes are laid out with an \textit{choose your own adventure} style in mind. The guided groups will roughly follow one of the levels (you always have the option of skipping Hero sections, even in the guided groups).
